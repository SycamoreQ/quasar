Quasar is a RISC-V based Neural Processing Unit in Chisel. 

Currently working on the Branch Prediction for the host CPU.
TODO: 
- Finish the Branch Predictor then the TAGE based stuff and finally wire it to the 
  iFetch module 
- A more farther goal is to integrate AXI system bus inspired and used in the Coral NPU
